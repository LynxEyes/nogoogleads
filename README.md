## No Google Ads

This is the simplest and silliest extension possible that simply removes the google injected ads from the google search results.
Yeah... that...

### Installing

1. Git clone
2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode
4. Load unpacked
5. Point it to the directory where the code is
6. Have beer

Also.. use DuckDuckGo.

Works on Chome, Opera and Vivaldi. Might work on others too, IDK.

PS: remember to give it access
