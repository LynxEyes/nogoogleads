## No Google Ads

This is the simplest and silliest extension possible that simply removes the google injected ads from the google search results.
Yeah... that...

Download the packed extension, install and be happy.
Also.. use DuckDuckGo.

Works on Chome, Opera and Vivaldi. Might work on others too, IDK.


PS: remember to give it access
